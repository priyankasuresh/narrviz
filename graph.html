  <div id="narrzero" class="descr" width="400" height="1000" style="display: none"> A traditional dance form in Orissa, Gotipua depicts the story of Radha-Krishna. Earlier it was called Sangeetha Akaara but because the male performers take "sakhibhaav roop", it got renamed to Gotipua. There are four divisions in a traditional composition - mangalacharan, pallavi, abhinay and bhanda nrutya. We went to the Abhinna Sundar gurukul - a school where children live and learn the traditional art of Gotipua dance. They are trained in Yog, Martial arts and Dance for their practise, and live with their gurus.A boy takes the "Sakhi bhaav" roop as the lover (gopikas) and devotee of Krishna to depict and celebrate the story of Radha-Krishna. Along with Abhinay (art) it is also Pradarshan (display or performance).Mangalacharan has guru vandana - where they show respect to the teachers. This is because they believe that teacher is Sarvashreshta - because without guru you cannot have complete understanding of the world/life.In Sanskrit, a young tender leaf which is coming out is called pallav. So from an entire stream of rag, you are taking a small sprout of it and making a composition, as a one liner composition. Thereby, an entire dance composition happens in the pallav with variations on one line.Abhinay in art is a story - here that of Mahishasa Mardini story, where Durga devi rose out of the fire to protect her bhaktas from the devious asura Mahishasa. In the battle between Mahishasura and Devas, led by Indra, the latter were defeated as Mahishasura had a boon that he could only be killed by a woman.The Devas approached Shiva, Brahma and Vishnu to seek help. The three great gods combined their divine energies and created a woman.The Goddess thus created was Durga.Durga led a battle against Mahishasura and killed him, thus fulfilling the prophecy that he would meet his death at the hands of a woman. Durga, also known as Devi, Shakti and by numerous other names, is a principal and popular form of Hindu goddess.She is the warrior goddess, whose mythology centers around combating evils and demonic forces that threaten peace, prosperity and dharma of the good. She is the fierce form of the protective mother goddess, willing to unleash her anger against wrong, violence for liberation and destruction to empower creation. Bhanda nrutya - is a physical yoga form depicting the relationship between Radha and Krishna. Making figures like pyramids and other formations to physically manifest the iconography painted.</div>

  <div id="narrone" class="descr" width="400" height="1000" style="display: none"> Raghurajpur is known as the Heritage village of India where all the villagers are artists, birthplace of many forms of art including Pattachitra painting, Gotipua dance etc. In Raghurajpur, the walls of houses are painted to showcase themes like local deities, everyday life and other mythological stories.The paintings on the walls are highly imaginative, with inspirations from animals, deities and iconography. There is a community pond in Raghurajpur, where people from the village gather on occasions. The Gotipua dancers train for voice control and other movements in this water tank. At the entrance of the village is a board announcing Raghurajpur, the Heritage village. This is the community stage where performances and other announcemets and celebrations happen. The villagers source flowers and leaves to be sent to Puri, in the forms of offerings and garlands. Most of the functions of this village is to supply to the Puri temple. This is a display of a decorated Puri temple, in the style of Pattachitra paintings, showing the local deity Jagannath. Lots of clay dolls are made and sold in this village too. In the process, the moulds were put out to dry in the sunshine, which will later be painted. These are painted clay dolls, inspired by local stories on display in the village for sale. The Jagannath dolls are in the process of being painted in this picture, before the final products are being sold. This is an abandoned Jagannath-looking wooden doll found on the Puri beach. It is likely that it has travelled from Raghurajpur, where it seems to have been originally made. These dolls are found in a lot of places as locals believe that it will protect the area. In this picture, empty coconut shells are cured and put out to dry in the sun, before being painted. The yellow objects are cured empty coconut shells with a layer of background paints and outlines, put out to dry. The hanging objects are fully painted finished coconut shells, out as display to be sold. They are mostly inspired by the Jagannath deity. Other recyclable objects like glass bottles, beetle nut shells, sea shells are painted in Pattachitra painting methods and sold as well. This picture shows rice from a household that is put out to dry on the roads of the village.Rice is very staple to the Orissan diet. This is a typical Orissan thali - with everyday meal items displayed. Young boys performing the Gotipua dance in Raghurajpur. The locals are versed with percussion instruments which are used for announcements and other celebrations. Carved stone and marble are also displayed for sale in Raghurajpur. Popular themes like Buddha, Jagannath etc are available. There is great detail in these pieces. Here we observe an elephant carved out of stone, is smaller than the nail of the thumb. </div>

  <div id="narrtwo" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> On our 4th day in Orissa, we went to the Archeological Museum in Konark. Along with many displays in the galleries, we found an interesting painting on the ceiling of the exit. It is the story of Usha Parinayam. This is a panorama image of the whole work of Usha Parinayam. In pattachitra paintings, we find whole narratives within a single painting with internal divisions. The spatial and temporal difference is significant in these paintings. Usha, the beautiful daughter of Banasura, prays to Lord Shiva and Parvati, and learns the art of dance from Parvati. One day, Usha falls asleep and in her dreams she experiences an intimate and romantic love play with a handsome young man, not knowing who he was. Her companion Chitralekha identified him as Aniruddha, Lord Krishna's grandson, by painting his portrait from Usha's description. Chitralekha was not only an artist but also had mystical powers. She flew one night and brought Aniruddha to Usha's place while he was still sleeping, using her powers. When Aniruddha opened his eyes and saw Usha, he fell in love immediately. Usha and Aniruddha, after secretly courting for a long period, wanted to be married. Banasura was infuriated at finding out about this love affair and immediately jailed Aniruddha. As he was a great devotee of Lord Shiva, and as a boon had asked him and his entire family to guard the gates of his city. Meanwhile, Krishna who was in Vrindavan was called upon to rescue his grandson Aniruddha, and consent his wedding to Usha. Lord Krishna asked Banasura to consent the wedding of the couple. But Banasure refused and seeked the help of Lord Shiva to wage a war against Lord Krishna. A war ensued between the Hari (Lord Krishna and his followers) and the Hars (Lord Shiva and his followers), rivers of blood flowed and the city was named Tezpur (City of Blood). Both sides were nearly wiped out and a final battle followed between Lord Shiva and Lord Krishna, Lord Brahma requested both of them to stop the war by putting him between them. A discussion followed in which Lord Krishna convinced Lord Shiva that Banasura was acting wrongly in imprisoning his grandson, and disrespected Lord Shiva himself. Lord Shiva agreed, and Banasura was brought. Fearing his life he immediately agreed to the marriage.

  <div id="narrthree" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> On our visit to Raghurajpur, we learned about the process of making the famous Pattachitra painting, and the ordeal that goes on behind the scenes for one such work of art. All the pattachitra paintings are basically made of six colors. The villagers will make the color at a Govt restricted area where they get the stones. The artists and villagers source and make their own sustainable paints, gum and canvas. Paintings are generally used after two or three years of making to reduce the poisonous qualities and to increase tenacity. The main color is white and is made of sea shell. Boiling and curing of this shell makes white paint. As it is close to the Indian ocean, shells are easily procured to make white paint and deduce other paints from it. Hengula makes red and is also very expensive at about 15,000/kg. When working with red hengula and haritaal , if you paint immediately after making, then the painting turns black. This is also used to make the painting look antique. Black is made of “baniglam soot”, is the cheapest paint to make.Indigo made of Nilgiri stone. Haritaal makes yellow and is poisonous if you consume it. So it is handled carefully. The basic six colors are then mixed to procure other colors and only these are used in a single painting to maintain uniformity. All colors are mixed with udapal gum for the adhesive quality and binding. The colors would wear off so this helps with fixing also. In Raghurajpur, the artists display their art on the walls. It could be anything from narratives of their family deities to pictures depicting everyday life. Alongwith the painting by the artist of the house, he also supplies meta-data depicting themes and origins of his work. In this surrogate image of the larger canvas, we see Krishna riding on an elephant made of the bodies of the Gopikas. Gopikas are depictios of sages and devotees of Krishna, and he is said to be guiding them towards the ultimate enlightenment. In this surrogate, we see again with great detail Krishna is painted on the bodies of Gopikas. Another interpretation is that Gopikas who form the chariot are the five senses of our body and we look to Krishna to guide us without distraction. It takes one person around 2 months to make a painting. It is usually a single person endeavour because conceptualization of the narrative is different in the heads of different painters and there should be a uniformity.

  <div id="narrfour" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> On our first day in Raghurajpur, a traditional wedding procession was going on and we had the chance to witness the attire, music and performances during such an event. Before the function, there is drum and other percussion music with an announcement of procession at the village center. Everybody participates in the wedding processions, and contributes to it. On the walls of the house, a wedding invitation with names of the couple are painted for all the villagers and stays there. On the day of the wedding, the groom alongwith his family, a musical band and performers, dresses up in traditional attire and parades around the village before going to the wedding venue. The whole village is decorated with streamers. After the function, everyone in attendance is invited to a lunch feast. The puppet shows are usually very colorful and attractive, showing bride and groom dancing and celebrating. A wad of money is circled around the head of the groom to ward off the evil eye, and this money is donated to the performers.
  There are dancers who perform a variety of stunts while playing music and in various bhanda-nrutya positions. Here, the youth are standing on one man, while he is rotating on the floor. It is like a "Mooh Dikhayi" where all the elders in the village come out of their houses to witness the performance and bless the groom with gifts and money. It is a community event as the youngsters participate in the processions and dance.

  <div id="narrfive" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> The Sun Temple of Konark was constructed in the mid 13th century by Raja Narasinghs Deva-I of the Ganga Dynasty. It is conceived in the form of a huge chariot drawn by seven spirited horses on 12 pairs of wheels--after the mythical seven horse chariot of Sun God.The Sun Temple has lost its many of its original structures to time and disrepair, but the remaining structures confirm till today the infinite imaginative power of the artistes of the time and their inspiring contribution to Vaisnav Culture.The temple follows the traditional style of Kalinga architecture. It is carefully oriented towards the east so that the first rays of sunrise strikes the principal entrance.[4] The temple is built from Khondalite rocks.The original temple had a main sanctum sanctorum (vimana), which was supposedly 229 feet[6] (70 m) tall. Due to the weight of the superstructure (70 m tall) and weak soil of the area, the main vimana fell in 1837.[9] The audience hall (Jagamohana), which is about 128 feet (39 m) tall, still stands and is the principal structure in the surviving ruins. Among the structures, which have survived to the current day, are the dance hall (Nata mandira) and dining hall (Bhoga mandapa).The monument was also called the Black Pagoda'(Kaala Pagoda) by the European sailors. Konark Sun Temple used Iron beams for its structure.The temple complex is in the shape of a gigantic chariot, having elaborately carved stone wheels, pillars and walls.</div>

  <div id="narrten" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> It was the first temple we visited on the last day of our tour, Built in the 11th Century A.D during the reign of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, the Raja Rani temple is believed to have been originally called Indreswara. Wikipedia tells us the locals call the temple “Love Temple” because of the erotic carvings of the women and couple on the walls of the temple. The first thing that strikes you when you enter the temple is how well it is maintained with lawns and gardens. The temple itself stands amidst the greenery, elegant and graceful.The impression from the name of temple suggests, the idol might be a pair. In fact there is no idol inside the temple and thus no puja is offered in the temple.The temple was constructed of dull red and yellow sandstone locally called "Rajarani". Rajarani Temple is built in the pnahcratha style on a raised platform with two structures: a central shrine called the vimana (sanctum) with a bada (curvilinear spire) over its roof rising to a height of 18 m (59 ft), and a viewing hall called jagamohana with a pyramidal roof. The entire Vimana and the temple is covered in minute sculptural designs. Imagine sculpting designs like these manually with no machines or tools except maybe a chisel and a hammer...We can bow down to the patience of those ancient sculptors.</div>

  <div id="narreleven" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> Dhaulagiri is a small hillock surrounded by plains, around 7 km from the Bhubaneshwar on the bank of river Daya. Dhauli, as it is locally known, is believed to be the place where the famous Kalinga war was fought in 260 BC. Over 250,000 lives were lost in the bitter battle. It is said the waters of the nearby river Daya had turned blood red due to the merciless bloodbath. On the top of the hill, a dazzling white peace pagoda welcomes us there and it has been built by the Japan Buddha Sangha and the Kalinga Nippon Buddha Sanghain the 1970s. As the name suggests the Shanti stupa due to its serene and calm surroundings and atmosphere is also known as the Buddhist Peace Pagoda. Lord Buddha used to preach here. His preaching's were so strong that King Ashoka renounced war and embraced Buddhism. It is here Emperor Ashoka gave up arms and embraced peace and today a Japanese built peace pagoda marks the historical event. Located around is also a stunning profile statue of an elephant and some lovely gardens.</div>

  <div id="narrtwelve" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> Patachitra is an ancient folk-art, which has a long history of 2500 years to its development and contribution to our society. Now this kind of folk-art has become a popular folk-art in Indian society and has crossed Indian border to foreign lands. The art of storytelling has been intrinsic to the culture of the region since days of yore and this has manifested itself in diverse art forms, Patachitra being one of them. Pats were scrolls on which mythological or epic stories were painted in a sequence – this would then be carried by Patuas who would travel from one village to another unrolling and showcasing these and singing of various mythological stories. However, the use of pats was not only limited to storytelling – this form of art was a part and parcel of the people’s daily life. Almost every house had its share of patachitra. Patachitra, known for its luminous play of colours, is of two kinds— art on a broad sheet of folded cloth and ‘eye-art’ on a short piece of fabric. The fabric in fact forms the base for pat art. Clay, cow-dung and some sticky elements are skillfully added to the fabric. When dried, the fabric becomes tough but mellow enough to sustain the stroke of the artist’s brush. Pata artists draw on it religious motifs, such as gods and goddesses, Puranic stories, slokas, etc.</div>

  <div id="narrthirteen" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> Konark Temple is a remarkable architectural wonder and the most famous Sun temple in the world. It was built by Narasimhadeva I in the 13th century CE and is one of the most popular temples in India. People from all across India and the world visit this ancient marvel and are awestruck by its beauty and majesty. There is quite an interesting legend associated with the Konark Sun temple - it's called 'Story of Dharmapada'. The legend also explains why the temple was never used in it's entire history and also gives a logical story of why it fell apart. The Famous Indian poet and Nobel Prize laureate Rabindranath Tagore wrote of Konark as "Here the language of stone surpasses the language of man." The impressive temple resembles a huge chariot with 24 huge wheels being pulled by seven horses. Great pairs of large intricately carved wheels were carved on both sides of the 4m high platform that the temple is on. There are two rows of 12 wheels on each side of the temple. Some say the wheels represent the 24 hours in a day and others say the wheels represent 12 months. While the art, craft, and architecture of Konark are widely spoken about, the temple is a testament to logic and science too. </div>

You can find splendid Edicts of Ashoka embossed on a mass of rock in Dhauli, beside the way to the hill summit. It is believed that Dhauli hill was the battlefield of the Kalinga War. The marvelous Shanti Stupa or Peace Pagoda is also located here. The overall structure of the stupa is in the shape of a dome. One can spot the Buddha footprints as well as the Bodhi tree over the stone panels. Dharmachakra mudra, used by Buddha during his first sermon following his enlightenment, represents continuous flow of energy. Dharmachakra is a Sanskrit word which means "the wheel of dharma." The mudra also symbolizes kalachakra, which refers to the time cycles. A reclining Buddha is a statue that represents Buddha lying down and is a major iconographic and statuary pattern of Buddhism.

A reclining Buddha is a statue that represents Buddha lying down and is a major iconographic and statuary pattern of Buddhism. It represents the historical Buddha during his last illness, about to enter the parinirvana[citation needed]. He is lying on the right flank, his head resting on a cushion or relying on his right elbow, supporting his head with his hand. This mudra symbolizes charity, compassion and boon-granting. It is the mudra of the accomplishment of the wish to devote oneself to human salvation. It is nearly always made with the left hand, and can be made with the arm hanging naturally at the side of the body, the palm of the open hand facing forward, and the fingers extended. The five extended fingers in this mudra symbolize the following five perfections: • Generosity • Morality • Patience • Effort • Meditative Concentration. The earth witness mudra is also called the Bhumi-sparsha ("gesture of touching the earth") mudra. This signifies that the earth is witness to Buddha achieving enlightenment. The construction of Shanti Stupa of Dhauligiri was assisted by Fuji Guruji and therefore, the place became the place of devotion and worship for various people belonging to different generations. One can also spot a number of stupas, chaityas as well as pillars whose foundation was laid by King Ashoka. </div>

To some Vaishnava Hindus, Jagannath is an abstract representation of Krishna; to some Shaiva and Shakta Hindus, he is a symmetry-filled tantric representation of Bhairava; to some Buddhists, he is symbolism for Buddha in the Buddha-Sangha-Dhamma triad; to some Jains, his name and his festive rituals are derived from Jeenanath of Jainism tradition. A circumstantial evidence that links Jagannath deity to Buddhism is the Ratha-Yatra festival for Jagannath, the stupa-like shape of the temple and a dharmachakra-like discus (chakra) at the top of the spire.His name does not appear in the traditional Dashavatara (ten avatars) of Vishnu,[5] though in certain Odia literature, Jagannath has been treated as the Ninth avatar.One of the most popular legends associated with Jagannath is that of Kanchi Avijana (or "Conquest of Kanchi"), also termed as "Kanchi-Kaveri". There is currently a prominent relief in the jaga mohan (prayer hall) of the Jagannath temple of Puri that depicts this scene.The murtis of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra and Sudarshana Chakra are made of neem wood.[30] Neem wood is chosen because the Bhavishya Purana declares it to be the most auspicious wood from which to make Vishnu murtis.The typical icon of Jagannath is unlike other deities found in Hinduism who are predominantly anthropomorphic. However, aniconic forms of Hindu deities are not uncommon. The eyes to show Jagannath is popular in Odishi art and it is known as Patita Pavan.The Jagannath triad are usually worshipped in the sanctum of the temple, but once during the month of Asadha (rainy season of Odisha, usually falling on the month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (Puri's main high street) and travel 3 km to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots, allowing the public to have Darshan (i.e., holy view).The icon of Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric face, and the icon has a conspicuous absence of hands or legs. The worship procedures, sacraments and rituals associated with Jagannath are syncretic,[2] and include rites that are uncommon in Hinduism. When shown with Balabhadra and Shubhadra, he is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to oval or almond shape shape of the other two abstract icons. Further, his icon is dark, while Balabhadra's face is white, and Subhadra icon is yellow. The third difference is the flat head of Jagannath icon, compared to semi-circular carved heads of the other two. </div>

   <div id="narreighteen" width="400" height="1000" class="descr" style="display: none"> On our weeklong trip, we went to a lot of temples, that were interesting. There are many sites that testify the importance of the region during the 7th to 11th century A.D when the Kalinga kings ruled Odisha and the regions beyond it. Belonging to the 11th century and enjoying the honor of being one of the 'char dhams', the pilgrimage that every Hindu intend to visit; Jagannath Temple is the honor of Puri and Odisha (Orissa). The holy sight of Lord Jagannath, accompanied by Subhadra and Balabhadra raises loads of joy among the devotees.Raghurajpur is a heritage crafts village in Puri district, Odisha, known for its master Pattachitra painters, an art form which dates back to 5 BC in the region and Gotipua dance troupes, the precursor to the Indian classical dance form of Odissi. It is also known as the birthplace of one of the finest Odissi exponents and Guru, Kelucharan Mohapatra.Konark Sun Temple (Odia: କୋଣାର୍କ ସୂର୍ଯ୍ୟ ମନ୍ଦିର)is a 13th-century CE Sun Temple at Konark in Orissa, India. It is believed that the temple was built by king Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga Dynasty[2] in 1255 CE.Just 8 km away from Bhubaneswar looking down on the plains that bore witness to the gruesome war waged on Kalinga by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great, stand the rock edicts of Dhauli. It was here that Ashoka, full of remorse after the Kalinga War in 261 BC, renounced his blood-thirsty campaign and turned to Buddhism.Dating back to 10th century this temple marks an important transition point between the early and the later phases of the Kalinga architecture. The highlight is the magnificent torana - the decorative gateway, an arched masterpiece, reminiscent of Buddhist influence in Orissa.Chausathi Jogini Mandir (64 Joginis Temple)(Odia: ଚଉଷଠି ଯୋଗିନୀ ମନ୍ଦିର, ହୀରାପୁର) is situated in a hamlet called Hirapur,[1] 20 km outside Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha state of Eastern India.[2] The temple is believed to be built by the Queen Hiradevi of Bramha dynasty during the 9th century.Rajarani Temple is built in the pancharatha style on a raised platform with two structures: a central shrine called the vimana (sanctum) with a bada (curvilinear spire) over its roof rising to a height of 18 m (59 ft), and a viewing hall called jagamohana with a pyramidal roof.Orissa is well known for the ancient caves located in the twin cities of Udaygiri (meaning the hill of the sunrise) and Khandagiri (meaning the broken hill).Udaygiri caves are approximately 135 ft high and Khandagiri caves are 118 ft high. The caves are reminiscent of influence of Buddhism and Jainism in Orissa. The origin of the rock cut caves of Udaygiri and Khandagiri dates back to the 2nd century BC.</div>
